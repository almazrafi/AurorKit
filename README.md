AurorKit is a collection of tools and extensions to help you develop apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS platforms.


## Requirements
- iOS 10.0+ / macOS 10.12+ / watchOS 3.0+ / tvOS 10.0+
- Xcode 10.2+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation
### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate AurorKit into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), specify it in your `Podfile`:
```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'AurorKit'
end
```

If you don't need all the features of AurorKit, you can also include only the necessary dependencies using submodules:
- Extensions: `pod 'AurorKit/Extensions'`
- Events: `pod 'AurorKit/Events'`
- Log: `pod 'AurorKit/Log'`

Finally run the following command:
```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:
```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate AurorKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:
```ogdl
github "almazrafi/AurorKit" ~> 0.1.0
```

Finally run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `AurorKit.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate AurorKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/almazrafi/AurorKit.git", from: "0.1.0")
```
and then specify `"AurorKit"` as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use AurorKit.

Here's an example `Package.swift`:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    products: [
        .library(name: "MyPackage", targets: ["MyPackage"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/almazrafi/AurorKit.git", from: "0.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyPackage", dependencies: ["AurorKit"])
    ]
)
```

### Manually
If you prefer not to use dependency managers, you can integrate AurorKit into your project manually by adding the [AurorKit](AurorKit) folder to your Xcode project.
